# Custom Physics Simulation
This project is dedicated for educational purposes. Feel Free to enjoy the experience.
    
## Description
This project was the outcome of my studies during in PhysicsEngine Module during my IT engineering studies speciialized in Game development.
The project has some limitatons as well as bugs thtI struggled to fix, Please reach out to me if you achieved a better, more realistic behaviour.
Feel free to donload the project, experiment with it, and use it for education purposes.

## Instruction (Plug and Play)
The project consists of one script to be attached to a 3D project that has no Unity Physics components.
Drop the object in the scene, Lift the object up, play, and watch the object react.
Experiment with the values to achieve a more desireable outcome.
